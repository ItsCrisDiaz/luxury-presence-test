                Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury
                real estate marketing company.
              </h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is
                their ability to market your property to the right target
                audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be
                able to identify who will be interested in your property and
                implement effective strategies to reach them via their website,
                paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work
                with an agent who has partnered with
                <span>Luxury Presence</span>, you benefit from the many
                different types of marketing capabilities the company offers.
                Here is how:

              <p>
                To reach your potential buyers,

                their time online, and how they make their buying decisions.
                Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to
                identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook,
                Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in
                your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and
                targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those
                who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

              <p>
                Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate
                agent has to promote your property. Being able to create
                high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an
                essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real
                estate marketing services above their competitors. According to
                a recent survey,
                <span
                  >85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent
                  who uses video</span
                >
                —and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect
                with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and
                rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are
                showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and
                live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do
                with a written description.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important.
                Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant
                terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence
                get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create
                blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                property attractive to potential buyers.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Recent research has shown that
                <span>44% of buyers found the home they purchased</span> on the
                internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they
                wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your
                home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate
                agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The
                effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine
                optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly
                using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO
                experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer
                searches terms that match your home, your property will show up
                in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn
                more.

              <p>
                If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he
                or she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to
                invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs
                to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they
                need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service
                providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather
                your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let
                an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury
                Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories
                and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in
                their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an
                influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home
                and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

              <p>
                Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If
                an agent doesn’t have a responsive, user-friendly website that
                is easy to navigate and provides an immersive experience for
                viewers who want to look at properties, they’ve already lost
                their advantage. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence have
                websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals
                who know what property buyers want. Their sites are designed to
                impress with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities,
                and lead capture strategies that help agents sell your home.
                Agents are further supported by analytics reporting, SEO
                optimization, third party integrations, and a reporting
                dashboard to help them easily utilize their site and maximize
                its potential. An agent who is backed by a powerful website is
                one who can easily reach a niche audience, streamline the
                selling process, and ensure your home gets the best promotion
                possible.

              </h2>
              <p>
                No matter how many powerful tools your real estate agent has at
                his or her disposal, sometimes word-of-mouth marketing is still
                the best way to sell a property. Agents who work with luxury
                real estate marketing services are connected with referral
                partners and a community of agents who can help them find the
                perfect buyer for your property. They can market your home
                specifically to individuals they’ve identified through their
                sources to be ready to purchase a home just like yours. This
                allows them to bypass traditional listings, saving both of you
                time, money, and unnecessary frustration.
                <span>17 of the world’s top 100 agents</span> work with Luxury
                Presence, putting your agent in elite company that elevates them
                in both professionalism and influence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing the right real estate agent is the most important
                decision you will make when you’re ready to sell your home. When
                you work with an agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence,
                you will be hiring one who has a powerful marketing team at his
                or her side.
